It's time for the Midterm Project! This project is designed to allow you to demonstrate your ability to organize a dataset for analysis, and to prepare a forecast based on the data that you have available to you: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce

### Goal
Your goal with this data is to provide the following:
- A three-month forecast of future sales (numbers and figures)
- Determine the three best-selling categories, and create a forecast of growth in those categories
- Determine the fastest-growing category, and create a forecast for its growth
- Any other insights that you decide are worth mentioning
